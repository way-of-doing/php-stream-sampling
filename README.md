# Stream Sampling

## Task

Please write a script that receives and processes an input stream consisting of single characters. The stream is of unknown and possibly very large length and the script should work regardless of the size of the input.

The script should take one parameter, the sample size, and generate a random representative sample using that many characters.

As for receiving the data the tool should work with two kinds of inputs:

- Values piped directly into the process using `cat input.txt | yourScript`
- Values generated by using a secure random source from within the language

Efficiency, memory consumption, testing, and a clean coding style are all important criteria to you keep in mind.

## Example

Given a sample size of 5 and the following stream of characters as values

`THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG`

A possible random sample could be:

`EMETN`
